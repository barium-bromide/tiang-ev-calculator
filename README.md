## 📖 How to Use

    - Tap cards as they are played by other players to remove them from the deck.
    - The counter on each card shows how many are left.
3.  **Calculating (Calculator Mode):**
    - Click the top bar to switch to **Calculator Mode**.
    - Select your two "Tiang" cards (the gateposts).
    - The App will display the **EV** based on the remaining cards in the deck.

## 🧠 The Math

The Expected Value (EV) is calculated using the following formula:

$$
EV = \frac{2 \times \text{Win Outs} - \text{Tiang Outs}}{\text{Total Remaining Cards}} - 1
$$

*   **Win Outs:** Cards strictly between your two selected cards.
*   **Tiang Outs:** Cards matching one of your selected cards (if the game rules penalize hitting the post).
*   **Total Remaining:** Cards left in the deck(s) after accounting for discards and your current hand.
